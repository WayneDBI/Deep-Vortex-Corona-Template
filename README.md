**Deep Vortex Vortex Spinning Arcade action!
Starts Hard….. Gets Hard……. Ends Hard!**

In this template / game you need to see how long you can stay alive.. Sounds simple? Just move the player left and right to go around the vortex as the shapes come flying towards you.. Rotate through the gaps and avoid touching the walls – otherwise it’s GAME OVER… Again, and again, and again!
To spice things up we’ve added a hypnotising background effect that dances and entrances you in time with the music..

Easily add more walls and shapes to create an even more complex and puzzling game!
